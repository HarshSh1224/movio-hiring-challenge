As I am currently in my second year of Software Engineering at Delhi Technological University, I am currently focussing on improving my programming skills, by:
Participating regularly in online coding contests
Practicing Data Structures and algorithm
Working on Flutter projects

And I feel my field of deliberate practice is Data Structures and Algorithms.
